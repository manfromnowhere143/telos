# Telos

**A research program for verifying autonomous agent work by evidence, not by trust.**

No model result is claimed yet. The repository begins with a completed target survey:
[`experiments/iter00_target_survey`](experiments/iter00_target_survey/RESULT.md), which selected a
hybrid Telos overlay on public software-agent tasks.

The question is narrow and testable:

> When an AI agent says a long-horizon task is done, can an external protocol prove that the real
> objective was completed, that the agent did not merely satisfy the visible proxy, and that it
> stopped at the correct boundary?

The target is not a better chat transcript. The target is a receipt-bearing completion protocol:
tests when code changed, typecheck/build when applicable, diff-scope checks, live-domain checks
when production behavior changed, artifact hashes, stated acceptance criteria, named falsifiers,
and an adversarial review pass.

  [`experiments/iter39_public_task_protocol_effect_slice`](experiments/iter39_public_task_protocol_effect_slice/RESULT.md).

- Public task protocol-effect runner recovery: passed through three isolated GitHub Actions
  CodeClash runner checks with zero provider spend in
  [`experiments/iter41_public_task_protocol_effect_runner_recovery`](experiments/iter41_public_task_protocol_effect_runner_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Public task protocol-effect execution retry: blocked before provider execution because the
  provider-capable harness, cost capture, and raw-artifact redaction controls were not recovered in
  [`experiments/iter42_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_retry`](experiments/iter42_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_retry/RESULT.md).
- Provider execution harness recovery: passed with a non-GPU ephemeral runner lifecycle probe,
  zero provider model calls, zero provider spend, and zero full task-condition pairs in
  [`experiments/iter43_provider_execution_harness_recovery`](experiments/iter43_provider_execution_harness_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Public task protocol-effect execution after harness recovery: blocked before provider execution
  because the recovered harness still disables full task-condition execution in
  [`experiments/iter44_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_after_harness_recovery`](experiments/iter44_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_after_harness_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Public task-condition executor assembly: passed as a dry-run manifest with six frozen pairs,
  zero provider model calls, zero provider spend, no cloud runner, and full execution still disabled
  in
  [`experiments/iter45_public_task_condition_executor_assembly`](experiments/iter45_public_task_condition_executor_assembly/RESULT.md).
- Public task protocol-effect execution with assembled executor: blocked before provider execution
  because provider overlays were not bound into pair commands and the recovered harness still
  disabled full task-condition execution in
  [`experiments/iter46_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_with_assembled_executor`](experiments/iter46_public_task_protocol_effect_execution_with_assembled_executor/RESULT.md).
- Provider task-condition command binding recovery: blocked and narrowed the plan to two
  provider-ready BattleSnake pairs while keeping four incompatible pairs visible in
  [`experiments/iter47_provider_task_condition_command_binding_recovery`](experiments/iter47_provider_task_condition_command_binding_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible protocol-effect slice refreeze: passed with two selected BattleSnake
  provider-compatible pairs, four excluded historical pairs, zero provider calls, zero spend, no
  cloud runner, no GPU, and no Sentinel resource modification in
  [`experiments/iter48_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_slice_refreeze`](experiments/iter48_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_slice_refreeze/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible protocol-effect execution retry: blocked before provider execution because
  the two-pair execution wrapper is not yet committed and the recovered provider harness still
  disables full task-condition execution in
  [`experiments/iter49_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_retry`](experiments/iter49_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_retry/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible execution wrapper recovery: passed as a zero-spend dry run with two selected
  BattleSnake pair plans and four rejected historical exclusions in
  [`experiments/iter50_provider_compatible_execution_wrapper_recovery`](experiments/iter50_provider_compatible_execution_wrapper_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible protocol-effect execution with wrapper: blocked before provider execution
  because the wrapper is still dry-run-only and the baseline/Telos runtime conditions are not yet
  distinct beyond output directory in
  [`experiments/iter51_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_with_wrapper`](experiments/iter51_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_with_wrapper/RESULT.md).
- Provider condition runtime separation recovery: passed as a zero-spend readiness gate with
  distinct baseline/Telos runtime commands, overlays, prompts, and a Telos receipt-validation path
  in
  [`experiments/iter52_provider_condition_runtime_separation_recovery`](experiments/iter52_provider_condition_runtime_separation_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible protocol-effect execution after condition recovery: blocked before provider
  execution because the pair executor is still intentionally unimplemented, the base harness still
  disables full protocol-effect execution, the pinned CodeClash checkout is not ready, and Docker
  readiness timed out in
  [`experiments/iter53_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_after_condition_recovery`](experiments/iter53_provider_compatible_protocol_effect_execution_after_condition_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider pair executor recovery: passed as a zero-spend readiness gate with pinned CodeClash,
  copied overlays, exact two-row command materialization, Docker daemon readiness through the
  current Docker Desktop binary, zero provider calls, zero spend, no GPU, and no Sentinel resource
  modification in
  [`experiments/iter54_provider_pair_executor_recovery`](experiments/iter54_provider_pair_executor_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible paid execution after executor recovery: blocked before provider execution
  because non-interactive ADC refresh requires reauthentication and dedicated-runner impersonation
  lacks token-creator access; zero provider calls, zero spend, no cloud runner, no GPU, and no
  Sentinel resource modification occurred in
  [`experiments/iter55_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_executor_recovery`](experiments/iter55_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_executor_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider auth recovery for paid protocol effect: passed by repairing local ADC non-interactively
  and making one minimal Vertex access probe with a `$0.01` spend bound, while executing no
  BattleSnake row and committing no account, project, service-account, VM, zone, token, or
  credential material in
  [`experiments/iter56_provider_auth_recovery_for_paid_protocol_effect`](experiments/iter56_provider_auth_recovery_for_paid_protocol_effect/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible paid execution after auth recovery: blocked before provider model calls
  because the pinned CodeClash virtualenv cannot import `google.auth`; one baseline selected-row
  attempt reached round-0 raw evidence, the Telos row and all excluded rows remained unattempted,
  and committed metadata shows zero provider calls and zero cost in
  [`experiments/iter57_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_auth_recovery`](experiments/iter57_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_auth_recovery/RESULT.md).
- CodeClash Vertex dependency recovery: passed as a zero-spend local dependency gate; the
  CodeClash virtualenv now imports `google.auth`, the pinned commit and frozen provider configs
  stayed unchanged, and no paid row, provider model call, GPU, cloud runner, or Sentinel resource
  was used in
  [`experiments/iter58_codeclash_vertex_dependency_recovery`](experiments/iter58_codeclash_vertex_dependency_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible paid execution after dependency recovery: blocked after both selected
  BattleSnake rows executed because Vertex returned a redacted model-not-found-or-access-denied
  response for the configured provider model; the run recorded two provider calls, zero cost in
  CodeClash metadata, no excluded pairs, no GPU, no cloud runner, no Sentinel mutation, and no
  verified-completion evidence in
  [`experiments/iter59_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_dependency_recovery`](experiments/iter59_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_dependency_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Provider model binding recovery: blocked after adding `vertex_location: global` to the recovered
  provider model overlay; the LiteLLM probe moved past the prior location error but returned a
  redacted `CONSUMER_INVALID`/quota-project response, with one provider call, no row execution, no
  excluded pairs, no GPU, no cloud runner, no Sentinel mutation, and no benchmark/model claim in
  [`experiments/iter60_provider_model_binding_recovery`](experiments/iter60_provider_model_binding_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Vertex quota-project binding recovery: blocked after proving the Mini-SWE-Agent/LiteLLM
  `extra_headers` path exists; one bounded LiteLLM probe with `X-Goog-User-Project` still returned
  a redacted `CONSUMER_INVALID` response, with no row execution, no excluded pairs, no GPU, no
  cloud runner, no Sentinel mutation, and no benchmark/model claim in
  [`experiments/iter61_vertex_quota_project_binding_recovery`](experiments/iter61_vertex_quota_project_binding_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Vertex bearer token path recovery: blocked after proving LiteLLM custom headers can override the
  default Authorization header; one bounded LiteLLM probe with runtime bearer-token and
  quota-project headers still returned redacted `CONSUMER_INVALID`, with no row execution, no
  excluded pairs, no GPU, no cloud runner, no Sentinel mutation, and no benchmark/model claim in
  [`experiments/iter62_vertex_bearer_token_path_recovery`](experiments/iter62_vertex_bearer_token_path_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Vertex access path parity recheck: passed after current direct REST and LiteLLM probes both
  reached the selected Vertex global model using secret-safe runtime credentials; two provider
  calls occurred, observed LiteLLM cost was `$0.000014`, no BattleSnake row or excluded pair ran,
  no GPU, cloud runner, or Sentinel mutation occurred, and no benchmark/model claim is made in
  [`experiments/iter63_vertex_access_path_parity_recheck`](experiments/iter63_vertex_access_path_parity_recheck/RESULT.md).
- Provider-compatible paid execution after access-path recovery: passed as the first bounded
  two-row provider-backed protocol-effect measurement; baseline verified-completion evidence was
  `true`, Telos verified-completion evidence was `false` because the Telos row's receipt candidate
  failed validation, the primary delta was `-1`, 10 provider calls and `$0.070448` CodeClash
  metadata cost were recorded, excluded pairs stayed unattempted, no GPU/cloud runner/Sentinel
  resource was used, and no benchmark/model claim is made in
  [`experiments/iter64_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_access_path_recovery`](experiments/iter64_provider_compatible_paid_execution_after_access_path_recovery/RESULT.md).
- Current gate: receipt-schema prompt alignment after the iter64 Telos receipt failure,
  pre-registered in
  [`experiments/iter65_receipt_schema_prompt_alignment`](experiments/iter65_receipt_schema_prompt_alignment/HYPOTHESIS.md).
- Benchmark result: none yet.
- Provider-backed protocol-effect result: bounded two-row pilot only; not a benchmark result.
- Current target: Telos overlay on CodeClash + SWE-bench Verified public software-agent tasks.

Claim-boundary reviewer entry point:
[`experiments/iter31_claim_boundary_release_manifest/proof/claim_boundary_release_manifest.json`](experiments/iter31_claim_boundary_release_manifest/proof/claim_boundary_release_manifest.json).
It indexes the current claim-boundary proof packet and keeps failed/null rows, changed candidates,
and no-claim exclusions visible. It is not a leaderboard, SWE-bench, production, live-domain, or
model-superiority result.

Self-coverage reviewer entry points:
[`experiments/iter35_release_manifest_self_coverage_guard/proof/self_coverage_report.json`](experiments/iter35_release_manifest_self_coverage_guard/proof/self_coverage_report.json)
and
[`experiments/iter36_release_manifest_self_coverage_negative_guard/proof/negative_guard_report.json`](experiments/iter36_release_manifest_self_coverage_negative_guard/proof/negative_guard_report.json).
They account for the release manifest's own self-verification gates and negative fixtures without
changing the claim boundary.

This repo deliberately separates the research line from Sentinel. Sentinel proved a standard:
frozen bars, public baselines, nulls published, raw evidence committed, corrections on the record.
This repo applies that standard to autonomous agent completion.

## The First Number To Freeze

`iter00_target_survey` will score candidate benchmark families against seven criteria:

| criterion | meaning |
|---|---|
| frontier relevance | the problem matches current autonomous-agent failure modes |
| public baseline quality | there is a named benchmark, split, and published score |
| falsifiability | the protocol can fail clearly, before narrative interpretation |
| evidence surface | the task can emit receipts beyond a final answer |
| Aweb fit | Aweb can run and verify it without hidden fleet-scale infrastructure |
| saturation risk | current leaderboards have not made the target uninformative |
| operational cost | the first honest experiment is affordable |

The survey chose one of three actions:

1. Freeze the first public benchmark target.
2. **Freeze a hybrid benchmark built from public tasks plus Telos proof receipts.**
3. Publish a survey null if no candidate clears the bar.

## Candidate Target Families

The initial candidates are documented in [`benchmarks/CANDIDATES.md`](benchmarks/CANDIDATES.md):

- coding-agent completion: SWE-bench Verified, CodeClash, Terminal-Bench-style tasks
- AI R&D agents: METR RE-Bench-style research engineering tasks
- tool-using service agents: tau-bench-style policy and database-state tasks
- adversarial tool agents: AgentDojo-style utility/security tradeoffs
- custom Telos overlay: public tasks with receipt requirements added around them

The target was not chosen by taste. It was chosen by the frozen survey.

## Writing Standard

The language in this repo must stay below the evidence. A claim is allowed only when it has a
source, a receipt, a log, or a clearly marked hypothesis behind it. Nulls and blocked gates are
first-class results. Corrections remain in the record.
